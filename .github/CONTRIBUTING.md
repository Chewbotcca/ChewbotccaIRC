# ChewbotccaIRC Contributing Guide

Hey! Thanks for wanting to contribute to the bot, I have laid out some guidelines based off of one of the following:

| Contributing Guide
| --------------------------
| [Adding a Command](#adding-a-command)
| [Improving/Fixing a Command](#adding-a-command-that-already-has-an-issue.)
| [Other](#other-adding-a-command)

## Adding a Command

If you want to add a command, you have 2 options (yay sub-sub-categories)

| Adding a Command
| --------------------------
| A command that already has an issue
| A command that doesn't have an issue
| Other

### Adding a command that already has an issue.

Hey! Thanks for taking care of an issue, here's what you need to do.

1) Comment on the issue you want to add, saying that you're happy to take care of it.

2) I will respond with where you add the command, whether it goes in a new plugin or an existing one.

3) Add the command where I instructed and send a PR.

4) If it gets approved, yay! You're a contributor. Otherwise, rip.

### Adding a command that doesn't have an issue.

Want to add an command that isn't suggested? Go ahead and create an issue and say you're gonna take care of it. Then follow steps 2 - 4 of the above instructions.

### Other (Adding a command)

Other?? What else do ya need? Hop on irc and let's sort this out.

## Improving/Fixing a Command

If you want to improve or fix a command, go right ahead! Send a pr when you're done.

## Some commands are confusing without any descriptions, is there a list of commands and their descriptions?

You better believe it! [Check it out](http://files.chew.pw/CafeBabeMigration.txt).
