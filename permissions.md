# Bot & Staff Permissions

The bot allows you to have staff members, allowing you to give certain perms to certain people. Here's a list:

You can change permissions by [PREFIX]permissions (staff name) (permission node) (true/false)

| Permission
| ----------
| [restart](#restart)
| [fullchannelperms](#fullchannelperms)
| [botchans](#botchans)
| [eval](#eval)
| [die](#die)
| [changeconfig](#changeconfig)
| [changepermissions](#changepermissions)

## restart

This permission allows the staff member to run `!restart` and `!update`

## fullchannelperms

This permission allows the staff member to by-pass "You must be half-op or above to modify the channel option!". This allows the staff member to be treated as the highest ranking member of the channel by default (i.e. they're owner of the channel). This also allows them to run `!leave`

## botchans

This allows the staff member to run `!join` and `!part` channels, and can force the bot to join any channel.

## eval

This allows the staff member to run `!eval`.

**Note: ONLY give this command to people YOU TRUST!!! (or dumb people who don't know how powerful eval is), eval can easily wipe your hard drive, be careful!**

## die

This allows the staff member to `!die` and kill the bot. bye bye bot.

## changeconfig

This allows the staff member to `!config` and change config options.

## changepermissions

This allows the staff member to `!permissions`, giving anyone any permission.
